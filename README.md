## Welcome to my site for hosting my work on the ScharWeb Development App!

This app was inspired by an assignment requirement of including a favorites list. Because the requirement was of a personal nature, I decided to go with that idea and create an app for my website development business-in-the-making. This site includes 5 pages of assignment required html content that will need to be edited in order to be used for its intended purpose. The site features information about my qualifications and abilities; and how I can be contacted. The html pages include index, resume, languages, sites and contact. The site also includes a custom.css styling page and a main.js JavaScript page.
